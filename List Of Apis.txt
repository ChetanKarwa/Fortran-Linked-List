List of APIs that I consider are important enough to be included in the Fortran-stdlib:
- Element At  : Returns the element stored at index.
- push        : Append an element at the end of the list
- insert      : Insert an element at specfied index of the list
- pop         : Removes an element from the end of the list
- remove      : Removes an element present at given index
- set/replace : Replaces an element at the given index
- clear       : Deletes the whole list (Without memory leaks)
- Size        : Returns the size of the list 
- reverse     : Reverse the list
- sort        : Sort the items in the list (if homogenous, not sure)
- Concat      : Appends a list to another list
- slice       : Returns a Slice (a continous part) of the list
- splice      : Removes a continous part of the list
