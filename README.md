# Fortran-Linked-List
I have got this opertunity to contribute to fortran-lang under GSoC.
This repository contains all my files and modules that I develop for this project.

## Project Aim:
Fortran offers all the ingredients needed for building modules of various data types
such as linked-list, maps, binary tree, etc.
This project aims to implement a linked list module for stdlib of fortran-lang. I wish to provide a module that can
be used “off the shelf” by any Fortran user. The project mainly focuses on implementing
the most efficient linked list and not just a simple linked list

## Overview of what is implemented in this project until now:
- Implemented a straight forward heterogeneous generic linked list.
- Taken analysis of time to process and perform basic operations.
- You can also find a List of Apis that I plan to implement in future for the project. 
- The demo files basically contains the rough work for my project or the linked list modules implemented by some other fortran users which I use for reference.

## Currently in progress:
- Implement a list of lists.
- Above mentioned heterogeneous generic linked list will be used as a child list in this.
